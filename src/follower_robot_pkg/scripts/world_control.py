                        --- Gazebo Model Animation Node ---

This ROS node controls the animation of a model within a Gazebo simulation environment, specifically moving the model up and down.

The node performs the following functions:

1. **Initializes the ROS Node**: 
   - The node is named 'gazebo_models_animation'.
   
2. **Publisher Setup**:
   - Publishes to the `/gazebo/set_model_state` topic to control the state of the model in Gazebo. 
   - A `ModelState` message is used to set the position, orientation, and velocity of the model.
   - The `latch=True` option ensures that the last message is saved and sent to any future subscribers, which is useful for static data.

3. **Initial Model Setup**:
   - A `ModelState` message is initialized to represent the state of the model named "Portail". 
   - The current state of all models is retrieved from the `/gazebo/model_states` topic to locate the "Portail" model and store its index for further reference.

4. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continuously updates the model's position in Gazebo until the node is shut down.
   - **Stay Command**: 
     - The model's position is maintained by publishing its current position with zero linear velocity in the z-axis (vertical direction).
   - **Moving Away**: 
     - The model is moved upward by setting a positive linear velocity in the z-axis.
   - **Moving Closer**: 
     - The model is moved downward by setting a negative linear velocity in the z-axis.

5. **Position Smoothing**:
   - To prevent sudden jumps in the modelâ€™s position, the current position is always retrieved from `/gazebo/model_states` and used in subsequent position updates.

6. **Exception Handling**:
   - The node gracefully handles shutdowns and interruptions using a `try-except` block around the main function.

7. **Usage Context**:
   - This node can be used to animate any model within a Gazebo simulation environment, by simply changing the model name in the script.
